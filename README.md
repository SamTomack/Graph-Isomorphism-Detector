This is a relatively simple program to determine isomorphism between user-inputted graphs. If they are isomorphic, it provides the option to smoothly deform one to overlay with the other, supporting an intuitive idea of graphical isomorphism akin to topological isomorphism.

Double click to create a node, single click a node to select it. If a node is selected, single click whitespace or the selected node to deselect; backspace to delete; or single click another node to draw an edge between them. The switch graph button switches between the first and second graph, the reset button resets the program, and the check isomorphism button determines isomorphism between graph 1 and 2. If they are isomorphic, the morph button is enabled, which triggers the deformation animation.

Built in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
